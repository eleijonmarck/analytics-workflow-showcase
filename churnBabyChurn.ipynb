    "Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for any company because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving. This example we will examine the churn for telecom companies.\n",

    "## Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This labeling schema is arguably the most common classification schema which is called binary classification as I have only two classes to predict(churn or not). Even some of the multi-class classification problems could be expressed as a binary classification schema(one vs other classes). \n",

    "Therefore, it is a powerful/basic classification schema that you would use approximately 83%(put some random number > 50) of your machine learning problems."
