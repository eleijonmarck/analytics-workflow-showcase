Installation and configuration
------



#### Full installation

* [Download python for your operating system](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) is a great tool if you are unsure of packages and the command line interface
* familiar with coding, goto ***tl;dr***

#### tl;dr
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install requests
pip install matplotlib
pip install lxml
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
```

##### Those interested in IPython Notebook

If you would like to run the IPython notebooks locally, (option 1. above), you'll need to install the following:

-  IPython 0.13+ is a requirement to view the ipynb files. It can be downloaded [here](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/install/index.html) 
- Necessary packages are Pandas, NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.   
   -  For Linux/OSX users, you should not have a problem installing the above, [*except for Matplotlib on OSX*](http://www.penandpants.com/2012/02/24/install-python/).
   -  For Windows users, check out [pre-compiled versions](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) if you have difficulty. 
   - also recommended, for data-mining exercises, are [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) and [requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests).
